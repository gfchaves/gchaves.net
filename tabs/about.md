Howdy! Thank you for your visit on my little space on the "cloud" üòä

My name is Gon√ßalo Chaves, but everyone calls me by my last name Chaves - except my parents üòú

I've been working with information technologies for over a decade, from network and services administration I shifted along to software design and application development, mainly focused on web and cloud solutions.

Nowadays as a Azure architect, in charge of solution design, alongside agile development, best practices, and application life-cycle management adoption for the team's daily operations.

Along the design and development process, I always got engage with customers and partners, to develop end to end solutions, regarding the business priority for goals and company achievements.
I have always been enrolled in local tech-communities and user groups. Sharing and learning from personals experiences and keeping up to date to improve my self with new trends, best practices, patterns, and technologies.

Passionate about technology, agile methodologies, since the design to best practices adoption, the development patterns, and the architecture of scalable and reliable solutions, are the main lines that I like to work with for exceeding customer expectations.

I also have a special interest in cloud technologies. Recently I had the opportunity to design and build a BigData solution-based with Azure and Google Cloud services. Enterprise architecture is my latest focus, and I'm working on a new approach to be applied as an alternative to the regular EA frameworks.

This website is my blog, where I would like to write about my work and my thoughts - hope that my posts can help or give another perspective.
