That's right! Accordingly with Wikipedia (and as far I remember, at the time with some community talks about it) Microsoft Azure (formerly Windows Azure) went out to the public on February 1st, 2010, so this year 2020 marks the ten anniversary. Not so much for Microsoft product when compared with older brothers (such as the windows, or office), what I would like to remark is how bigger it's today, and at his core how different it is.

I didn't remember the last technical session that kept me really glued with the speaker and the theme itself, but I was trying to get some more knowledge regarding the Azure internals, in which founded the right designation - Fabric Controller and [I founded a TechEd 2013 session with Mark Russinovich Windows Azure Internals](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/videos/teched2013-northamerica-windows-azure-internals/). (I do recommend although probably if somewhat outdated as today architecture, but concepts and base definitions are pretty much valid today ðŸ˜Š). 

Ok, so let's try to find how much different is Azure at his core from 2013 and 2020 ... godspeed ðŸ˜‚ - and them the same Mark Russinovich (now as a CTO for Windows Azure) gave last year at Microsoft Ignite another session ["Inside Azure datacenter architecture with Mark Russinovich"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-0V6bYfTpA) and then we can understand how really azure grew in only seven years:

## 2013

## 2019

`46 new regions!`

These numbers really show how much bigger it's now, and keeps growing! If you like deep technical architecture I recommend viewing the two sessions. Also regarding the hardware itself, I saw another fact that I would like to point out:
![az-hardware-1](/assets/img/posts/az-hardware-1.png)

From Gen 2 with 32GiB RAM to Beast v2 with 12TiB RAM! - These numbers are really impressive! And show us how much the industry is committed and moving into Azure and becoming more demanding with hardware and services capabilities.

Well, I'm sure that in other more seven years we'll find how much bigger it is, and probably the fiber cable extensions will be the length from Earth to Mars ðŸ˜‚.
