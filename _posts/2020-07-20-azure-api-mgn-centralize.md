**Centralized: Security, governance, policies, and authentication**

That's right! If you think about the enterprise architecture strategy for your company's APIs you've certainly come across these matters. How to handle with a unified way throughout every single application APIs. SOA must be a reality within your services and strategy, a good way to provide interoperability and share vital information across multiple applications to enrich and deliver more at your services.

With Azure API Management you can rely on a single platform to create and perform a centralized gateway to enforce policies, authentication, routing, versioning and even mocking responses to provide a fast-way for developers to start integrating with upcoming new services.

APIM is not an identity provider itself, rather it can delegate the authentication step to providers that can implement. Although it can integrate directly into Azure Active Directory and provide access token validation.

Your APIs traffic should converge into your Azure APIm and then routed to your backend APIs. Also, secure those backends communications as well, using preferably Managed identities. (automated authentication service - easily can authenticate your self regarding what resource you represent and forget about static credentials that will be stored somewhere)
