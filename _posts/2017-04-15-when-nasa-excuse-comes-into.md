A lot has been said and written about leadership and principles of how to properly lead. No matter the type of leading, I always believe that there are some principles that never should be violated or adjusted or twisted regardless the current situation or project's emergencies. I'm not acknowledging that I'm some kind of expert or something alike, but leadership has a lot to handle and to be aware of.

For the past few years, I read and found a lot of post, books, presentations, quotes and people that lead by example and are always excel to bee better and able to handle decisions and responsibilities of theirs actions acting as a leader. Everyone can point out that has or had a great leader or someone that was a mentor that helped us on the right moments with the right wisdom. In my latest years at work, leadership was a kind of big trouble... unfortunate, if the position is pointed out only by status quo or something else, the consequences have huge impact not only on teams works, but on every single team member as a person. We know that people leaves jobs not only for money reasons, also because their leader didn't properly motivate them or inspired them to became better professionals, better versions of themselves. I have to make a disclaimer here: this is only my thought and ramblings regarding this matter. These are my exclusive opinions and aren't necessarily from our teams or colleagues. (We never know who's will read this post :P, right? )... disclaiming mode, out.

>That is my title and position in this organization, but it doesn't tell you who I am.

Having a great leader is almost the right need for every team, for individuals that seek for motivation, for right advice's and for support. And by support I mean, be there and handle together without taking over, at least if not required. I said before, there are lots of great readings, post, memes, and presentations about this subject and I'm not trying to make another perspective or adding something there... I just want to share some thoughts about **"how to lose someone from your team for ever, in five seconds..."** At our office, some years back, I read the famous article ["10 Sentences Good Managers NEVER Say - EVER"](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/10-sentences-good-managers-never-say-ever-bernard-marr?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_pulse_read%3BT5SNEibQRT2%2FGOIcKxIayQ%3D%3D) and I think that was so important and mindful that I printed out and hanged on one of the team's office corner. We have some other stuff hanged there, everyday some doubts, practices and patterns are asked and having some shortcuts on an eye sight is becoming very useful.


The goal was to never forget that there are really important sentences, words and expressions that should never say in team's core avoiding relationship damages that probably never will ended up back on. This remembers me that song... 

>(Nothingman, by Pearl Jam).

Of course there are many studies, techniques and "magics potions" that prevent or help leaders to be able back on track in case of "emergency" with a team mate. We all make mistakes and we all say some words or expressions that can and crank peoples feelings and hurt global team cohesion... But I believe that even on those bad moments the leader has to became around, be the best has he can and bring it up the team and members morals up and running. I've done that, and I look forward to always have the courage and the feeling to do it. See the situations when they are drawing on work days and be proactive on them. From the "ten sentences" that are famously enumerated they can apply on ever most situations, agree, but how about if we add another one? "We don't work at NASA..." (NASA please, don't be upset, it's only a metaphor, that was used. And we would be very appreciated if some day we could work as you :) ) yeah... that was said by someone that should never said those words... of course isn't not because of NASA it self... it was about the level of perfection that was printed on what team wanted to do... sounded like: "we didn't sold that kind of perfection, and we don't want to do things in that right way that you guys want to do.... do that fast.." or sounded also like some other team lead said before "... I prefer a bad but working code rather then good and structured working code..."... efficiency, bug tracking, re-usability and whatever the best practices advocates are road blocks for this leader. Probably what was at stake is over-delivery, and team wanted to believe that particular words were about. Yes, sometimes it's easy to extrapolate the job and deliver something else regarding the requirements or the functions that are expected... but `NASA` excuse, to justify that? Come on...

>No one ever made anything extraordinary happen alone. Leaders cannot possibly design breakthrough innovations, produce high-quality products, provide awesome service, attract raving fans, break sales records, ensure financial soundness and integrity, and build great places to work without the trust, teamwork, strength, and capabilities of everyone in the organization. Leadership is a team sport and not a solo performance.

We ended up by doing the `"NASA"` way, or a least we tried and we clear our consciousness, it's not about doing the hard way, but doing to handle future's changes and adaptions that we already know that will be required. The situation it self wasn't about over-delivery or team time consuming, because even that took ten or twenty more minutes to finish the task, it about whats team felt about it. If the "NASA" excuse comes into play, every single member is blinded and castrated regarding their individual skills, talent and the work is self driven only to be ready at time... with bugs... with that edge cases that no one tested out. This type of "culture" or leading guides leaves no ties between team members and their works... leaves no responsibility or self care about what we have being done over the years for our customers. People in leadership should create strong ties and relations between tasks and their performers, to create sense of responsibility and be accountable for actions, for the goods and for the not so goods...

>Change does not begin with someone else. Change begins in your own backyard, no matter your age or your size

Each time that a cheap excuse like this one or some other that is easily transferred into the "NASA" one, frustrates and breaks any type of consideration that we have on that leadership as a person and someone with a strategic grow or path for the team. Regarding impossible deadlines and costs, there are a lot of another ways that the equation could be presented and analysed with the team, but using those kind of "we don't need that you excel on this because..." clears anything and all ties that members have if their jobs and daily works. Let me share a situation that is recurring in some of the team members, it's assigned a one day task for a developer, that's ok. The developer delivers the task... well in most cases yes... next day the schedule of that same member is now another task from another customer, the manager takes a look on yesterday developer task and find a little bug and another breathtaking one... even after reporting those situations the developer not only don't be shamed or takes the responsibility to handle and put some extra work to fix his own mistakes, but throws another great excuse like: "well... no one else tested besides me... and now I can't fit on my working day... so it'll have to wait.". Isn't the "NASA" excuse... but reveals the lack of commitment and atitude as a person and a professional. This is a real and one of the most situations that reflects those excuses that comes by example from some leaders. I always heard that the example should came from top...

Of course we aren't NASA or we don't work like them, unfortunately and definitely I don't have the skills to work there (maybe some day), but is that a valid excuse? Should we be inspired for the great examples or learn and thrive for those that excel on every single task and are able to change human history? Shouldn't we be amazed by great challenges and be inspired by great companies, peoples jobs, articles and great leaders? Team work should be influenced or frighted in a matter that one more last test isn't required because the previous ones are working? Is there a limit that should be imposed on every single of us on our imagination and drive-perfection?

>Or, would you hire an untrained engineer to design a new self-driving car? Of course you wouldn't. So, why is this permitted with leaders?

Regarding this bad example or this horrible metaphor that was used by a person on a leading role, I felt that this one was personal, it was to most likely be offensive to my self, words were chosen quite close to something personal, on what is a role model for me. My team mates and everyone else on office, knows my passion regarding "these space stuff" (like some people refers to) but this wasn't a first time that an excuse of this magnitude was used. In the past, I remember that sometime the "NASA" was changed to another type of companies, and what I want to point out is that leading by these behaviours with these excuses, clearly have a deep impact on how each member relates to his own work and to the success has a team on a company business. If isn't reminded that customers satisfaction and how we can make real difference in theirs business, money don't get in and people get out.

>"What actually differentiates the expert performers from the good performers is their dedication to doing something every day to improve."

I read the fabulous article [Best Answer to “Sell Me This Pen”](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/best-answer-sell-me-pen-sufyan-nouman) many times, almost at that point that if I ever came across of a similar situation, I could remember myself that how to be ready and push hard for change the perspective in a way that words became from the defense into the offense side, no chance, it's a "NASA" alike atitude. Another great post about leaders work: [The four jobs](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/four-jobs-boss-has-do-abhijit-bhaduri?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_pulse_read%3BT5SNEibQRT2%2FGOIcKxIayQ%3D%3D) a boss has to do, i'm sure that most of those who are in leading roles have heard about the "barrier breaker", "bouncing board", "air covers" and "coach" terms and be able to justify them as a part of theirs jobs and no questions ask. But regardless what every one can talk or define each of those terms or the ten sentences, if leading isn't drive by self example and atitude, i'm quite sure that those rolling modules are quite misleading ones.

>To become an exemplary leader, the second fundamental is that you have to aspire to excel

Article quotes are from the book [Learning Leadership: The Five Fundamentals of Becoming an Exemplary Leader, by James M. Kouzes, Barry Z. Posner](https://kindle.amazon.com/work/learning-leadership-fundamentals-becoming-exemplary-ebook/B01CVM6PC6/B01ETYNJ6Y), so we should aspire to be as much as "NASA" we can be.

Every excuse used from leadership should careful applied and contextualized on each member and team context. A lot of business rules and politics variables are on track, although keeping people away from aspire herself, from the team excellence and at last the company success, clearly draws a collection of setbacks and ways that can lead into a self destruction. Strong ties between team mates and team work is very essencial for all of us who know that some days we aren't at the office, but the team will have under control regardless the project, the issues or the type of work that is necessary to overcame with. Strong ties, strong teams, strong ideas and strong trust can, as we saw, change the history and thrive every single of us to one day become "NASA" alike.

>"What we think, we become."

At least I try... every day working together with teams and members as individuals persons who have particular challenges and difficulties, but leadership isn't aspiring to excel, should lead by example not by words or excuses.
