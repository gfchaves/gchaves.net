Well, I always believe that the tools that we use to perform our task, besides on a professional or a nonprofessional way tools always should be a booster instead of something that requires our time seconds to understand, configure or event to a little barrier that always we need to cross in to start working. To better understand, imagine that every day you have to start your chain-saw to perform your work. If each day you took 30 up to 60 seconds you do the math and see how much time you spent in an entire year to warm up and start working. Also because I always felt that if tools are annoying and incapable to be up to our working speed I prefer not having then to struggle with each working day...

That said, and like every computer "geek" user I have some productivity tools that I always install on each computer or on every virtual machine/server regarding the operating system I use. Is like every time that I install the Visual Studio software suite the first plugin is the [Productivity power tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioProductTeam.ProductivityPowerTools) (guess by the name ;) ) the real big difference that can produce in your editor work every single day...

But what brings me to write this post today is another tool... On my current work role, I have many people that approach me for a quick tip or a resolution into some project, document, server configuration, dev operation, etc. And each time those operations require some copy & paste, access passwords, Url addresses, configuration keys ... you know... So many years ago I had a great colleague at work that he felt the same issue and the same frustration... the need to copy many things into system clipboard, window switch and then paste those values... believe me this tools can do a real difference in your work every single day. And after using for a while I realized that is something that the major operating system should already include this feature as a part of their base installation... like for instance... the major ones they all have a calculator and a screenshot... right? and how about a powerful [CLCL](https://www.nakka.com/soft/clcl/index_eng.html) ?

Also, I believe that the same applies to the tools we should be using, they should bring our best work into play and at a full speed. Time and good work is the key to the most companies products, right? So the little tool CLCL is a very light way multi-copy clipboard, you can copy many texts file, etc into his clipboard and use that historical afterward at everywhere you need! And after you start using it... you'll feel how a little thing can bring a real boost on you!

CLCL is for Windows platform, but there're other for Linux as well like the [ClipIt](https://github.com/CristianHenzel/ClipIt). The power of this tools is that you have a list of copied items at a single key combination stroke at your fingertips. I personal use the ALT-C combination to bring up the CLCL clipboard history and use it to paste every item I need. Sometimes we deal with many credentials and being switching windows to perform copy and past is annoying and time-consuming... with this type of applications that can make a real enhance on your operating system clipboard capability, it can make a Real difference at your daily work. Even when you reboot or power off it can store in a private file at your profile location so you can start pasting thing that you had copied on the previous day. Don't believe? try it for your self and let me know if had or not a boost impact on your daily productivity.


This is a sample from the CLCL (image credits of the nakka.com. You can assign a keystroke combination to bring up the CLCL context menu and select the item you want to paste.

This is the ClipIt version running on Ubuntu, image credits from LinuxInsiders. Also with a keystroke or with a single click you can access into your clipboard history.

I had many work colleagues that notice this feature on my computer and asked about it, how it work and how they can get it. So now here's for everyone you can give a shot at a little copy paste boost.
