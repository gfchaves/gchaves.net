That's absolutely right, a truthful sentence no matter of what context you might think. Problems and issues can take place everywhere no matter what scenario we face on and on every condition I can think of. First and before a dive on the book I strongly advice a 13 minutes and 49 seconds of a strong, raw and painfully wise words that Jocko says on his Ted Talk that you can find below. So please take a look, it's worthy.

Through eyes and a Navy Seal body the author drives us on a real war scenario where the situation requires the maximum of concentration, leadership and decision making that a human body can take. Those hard and cruel decisions that they have taken, some of them mislead into a dangerous situation that took the team safety on stake. The first impression and what I personally expect was that the leader took the full responsibility of the team actions. That said, the real deal here is regarding the leader decision is a sum from all team agreement based on the trust, respect and the strong connection that should unite the team during their performance on action. Trust and respect are foundations of a strong team that can rely on their leader. After reading the first chapter, I was imagining myself as one of their Seal members that was suffering the consequences of the actions that were taken.

I always believed, that hard work on team's foundation really pays off when special and rare situations comes in. And besides a real conflict on a war scenario, at my job I found myself on those similar situations that requires the same foundations and ownership to take action on the problem my team, myself included are facing. Ownership can be translated into the responsibility and here is where I found most of team's issues, I believe that the wins and loses of team starts on every single member.I specially enjoy watching and reading histories and reports of military actions, regarding their success or failure, because we can find that every single member has a special contribution, a single skill that can sum on the final result. Taking the real responsibility or the ownership of a situation is more hard then it looks... why? Because we continually draw lines of duty and stop owning the completude or action when the task or the situation need to be handled by other member or other department. One of the best examples that we can find on our daily jobs is, a feature that requires different skills to be completed. We shouldn't stop caring or taking action just because that particular part of the problem can't be handled by me and is on the hands of other member... and guess what... the easy way: "well that's is a back-end problem... so talk with the guys of the other room... I can't do anything else..." - Every time I hear a similar excuse I have to start counting... if we are a team, there isn't the "other guys room", I can take the issue with personal care and ask for help and be there to fulfill the gaps with other members to help them helping me for the ultimate goal to help the team, that helps the company who pays our salary.

>"For leaders, the humility to admit and own mistakes and develop a plan to overcome them is essential to success. The best leaders are not driven by ego or personal agendas. They are simply focused on the mission and how best to accomplish it."

I remember my mom saying that, please take attention into your colleagues... not everyone plays with hearts on the best interest and intention... And unfortunately I've saw leaders who throw their team members "under the bus" when taking ownership is a real deal when the responsibility is called on stage. We all make mistakes, and I'm not a exception of it... but not taking responsibility for actions is a lack of respect, and a specialty from leaders. Lead by example, lead with ownership and empower your team with these values, I truly know that is what makes me more confident when hard decisions needs to take place and with no win or lose on my personal agenda.

>"If an individual on the team is not performing at the level required for the team to succeed, the leader must train and mentor that underperformer. But if the underperformer continually fails to meet standards, then a leader who exercises Extreme Ownership must be loyal to the team and the mission above any individual."

Again, hard decisions are tough and not every leader has the courage and the responsibility to take a real ownership, to take on best interest the team it self but rather go easy on those who's actions "under-performer" the team itself and ultimately the company.

>"one of the most fundamental and important truths at the heart of Extreme Ownership: there are no bad teams, only bad leaders."

Not a easily excuse but a hard one to take. Bad leaders can take real damages on team's daily work and under-performance. Taking action and fell the pulse of every single member is a talent and a discipline that every leader should have on their first priority goal for the team and company's mission. Unfortunately I have seen leader's actions that had consequences of loosing great talents, great team's spirits and disengagement that resulted on "unmotivation" and drew even more hard lines between member's individual responsibility on job actions... It's very hard, it was like taking bullets from friendly fire! And more even sadly... that the real impression is took by personal agendas and blinds the eyes of those in charge of the company future.

>"if substandard performance is accepted and no one is held accountable" - "... there are no consequencesâ€”that poor performance becomes the new standard."

Poor performance becomes the new standard that leads on lack of accountability... No one takes the ownership when things goes sideways... exception when victory is on the spot. When every situation is lead by no critical factors then no accountability is required because that turns the daily basis rule. That's one of the reasons that the military procedures should be appreciated and learnt to take the medals or the consequences that are required to keep up with the standards of the performance that is held on team's goals.

>"Teams, are constantly looking to improve, add capability, and push the standards higher. It starts with the individual and spreads to each of the team members until this becomes the culture, the new standard."

To improve and to be on the edge, motivation, tools and resources should be at disposable, because no one can make scrambled eggs without the eggs... right?

>"There is no 100 percent right solution. The picture is never complete. Leaders must be comfortable with this and be able to make decisions promptly, then be ready to adjust those decisions quickly based on evolving situations and new information."

We can't born with every solution to every problem, but we can't hide or slide away the ownership of what we are assigned on. The solution, success or unsuccessful one should be owned by every single team member that together take special "extreme ownership" has their number one priority.

>"Leaders must be humble but not passive; quiet but not silent. They must possess humility and the ability to control their ego and listen to others."

I would like to remake the above quote to wrap up the extreme and joyful pleasure that Extreme Ownership book gave me. When the silence is imposed by of someone's ego is when the real problem is being cooked, so badly that the consequences are kept under like a field of mines... on every step we can blow our members, our projects and in the end the success of the business.

I strongly recommend this book as a required reading not only for leaders but for every single one of us, who work with teams, on teams and as member's of a successfully company business. Extreme Ownership is way more then a lesson, is a 352 pages of inspiration and successful recipes to have at hand as a powerful reminder for us as members today and leaders of tomorrow's. Five starts and purple heart prize. ðŸ˜Š
