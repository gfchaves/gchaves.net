I don't know if I ever could be an `astronaut`, or if I could handle all the types of pressures, fears, knowledge and what ever more each one that has the "lucky" to out on spacewalks, feels when they carry those astonishing missions. Despite all of that, we also know that space exploration is much much more that a single player or a single work area.

It's impossible to be indifferent when you start being touched by "space" things, such as reading, pictures, stories, books, movies or personal experience that you have when for instance you set down on a real Soyuz decent module capsule and start wishing have the same experience now over the mythic Space Shuttle. The Soyuz decent module is available for visiting at the [Cit√© de l'espace, Toulouse, France](http://www.cite-espace.com/) witch by the way is a great exhibition regarding this "space things".

A place that you should take a full day on it and if you visit like me you probably need two or three days. :) It's a great place not only for the young ones, but also for anyone you want to know or have interest on space explorations, historical facts, real models, and real scales rockets and satellites, lunar and Mars real stones pieces and even the Russian space station Mir the real prototype that was built to support space operations from the ground. all facts, experiences, and motion videos are also among the vast and rich collection of the exhibition hall. I have to return back, I miss that majestical place... that feeling when you start walking on Mir and all of my minds was believing that I started floating on a micro-gravity environment, is indescribable you have to feel it by yourself.

The interest started way back on a young age, but when you start to realize the real deal and what is at stake... definitely took me. So besides my technical readings, I started to look for documentation and books that could be a nice and easy introduction on this way long "world" of space... I ended up by downloading the book An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth from [Chris Hadfield](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-hadfield-03263019/), on a not so "nice" way... (sorry Chris, but hang on), and when I started reading... I forgot everything... I was thrown into a deep space where Chris has the magnificent way to print his passion and his experience on his missions, especially the last one aboard the iconic and unique ISS (International Space Station). It only took me hours to read the book and be excited to continue reading after each time that I needed to stop. That kind of book that you now wish that has another two hundred pages of inspiration, knowledge, and descriptions. I ended up buying the book and also bought the You Are Here: Around the World in 92 Minutes. congratulations Chris, I loved your writing and your work. It's was the closest way that I felt of being someone that took a step on a spaceship or even on space it self.

So as Chris asked on his TED talk presentation: "What is the scariest thing you ever done?" is a great example of inspiration and motivation that kept me thinking for days how or what I should answer if anyone or for a hypothetical job interview... It's a great talk that everyone should see, please do.

I ended up to see it for the third time. The difference from fear and danger and you finally feel that besides the most complex and complete spaceship ever built, that you are hanged on billions of burning fuel such a powered force that throw you into space, that you are out on s spacewalk and ended up completed blind... fear from danger, from attitude and preparations. Your experience, your hard work what you make everyday in such an automatically way that you even realize that you do that thing, is the recipe that Chris gives, among those beautiful images and breathtaking videos of launch and landing operations. I'm not sure that I have my answer for the Chris question... It's easy to think in some things that we may have done in the past that now we realize that were scary or even danger moves but I honestly think that Chris question is way more that those things. We should take the challenges, assess the risks and be fearless when to take those difficult decision, we should be ready and up to the questions or the situations that make us think what is the scariest thing you ever done. I'm thinking write other article just for the answer of this question.

Back to space, all knowledge, technology and experiments that are being cary on ISS and on each space agencies are allowing us as humans to understand more deeper what is living in a micro-gravity environment for long periods and those changes on a human body to be possible to produce the next steps on space explorations. Mars, and other planets are for sure in the horizon, but I first a lot of preparations, knowledge and technology is a requirement to go further. if we think that when I was a child talking about a men on the moon was the wow effect, imagine that in some years when we talk about human beings living outside earth for good, by conducting life and everything as we know in a other planet.

It's not for the exploration perspective that calls my personal adventure side, I consider my self a "fearless" person, but that doesn't mean you don't need to assess what is ahead and consequences that could come out, it allows you to be smarter and be able to not panic on those "blind moments" that you come across when you are on uncommon ground, and that's what is all about, be ready for ever situation that you might came forward. Change the mind set from the standard success case for the error and critical cases, how you can handle them, and how our technology and knowledge can help us to improve and be successful on every step of our professional and personal journeys. At a first sight is not easy to see what space exploration has done so far for every one of us, or at least is not easy to assess the real deal after the common knowledge that space missions have brought to us. Nowadays the current experiments aboard the most sophisticated and expensive orbit laboratory aka ISS, are the common ground for next decades of space travel that allow to have a life as we know it outside the earth.

So when you have to imagine all that is required to boost a spaceship that can be able to win the earth gravity and get into orbit, all components from hardware, fuel, engines, mechanical components, chemistry, navigation systems, communications, and all that software that allows hardware and all other components work as a team to build a contained explosion that take astronauts safe in orbit and back down on earth... if you stop for a moment and start to imagine what is at stake for all of this to happen... is huge and impossible to ignore that we are in front of the most complex and bright work of all companies and people that can delivery and accomplish this.

Space Shuttle... **"...the most complex and complete spaceship ever built.."**, from 1981 to 2011 with 135 missions a low orbit reusable vehicle that carry out flights that assisted and built the ISS and deployed the Hubble Space Telescope, among other things that even I don't know or maybe aren't public, for safety purposes I guess. I'm not considered a person that can talk about the shuttle or any other space things, I'm just an enthusiast that drinks information about on these matters from available channels that NASA and ESA have published. What I want to point out is that besides the unbelievable cost of each space shuttle mission what he accomplished maybe is beyond us or just will be perceptible in the next decades. A lot of people has worked for STS missions not only NASA or the USA, but I found out that a local Portuguese cork company, a reference one, has developed components for aerospace technology on ablative thermal protection with such a simple component of our [local nature cork](http://www.amorimcorkcomposites.com/en/materials-applications/aerospace/), I found out because the website was developed by a company that I worked for.

I also believe that other companies not only Portuguese ones are working every day, developing but also researching for spatial related technology, and that is very very important because, it means that every single country, every single culture, and person can contribute for such an amazing and extremely expensive space explorations programs. not only universities and private companies but also individuals that are contributing in non-direct way for this to happen. So such dreams, such technology that we are seeking he has to believe that is possible, because ... hey... we have an incredible space exploration in just fifty decades, what can stop us in the next ones? I can't compare my daily work when it comes to this matters of space, it's another world, a different reality, a bunch of complete variables... but we can find common grounds, and that's what I want to point out, that's is where I find that inspiration that we still can achieve a greater good, a different perspective, a completion and examples of excellency, references and patterns that allows us not just learning but also apply those on our daily bases.

We all need references, examples, leader-shipment, challenges, objectives and something that can empower ours self to achieve steps forwards on our work, on life that can bring something better for the greater good. In my opinion space exploration, is the "hub" of all human knowledge and work, I would say that it's hard to find something that someone developed, build or founded that can't be applied on missions, maybe on ground or on orbit but we can find from anything from anywhere above all expertise and disciplines, it's like the Olympics of our intellectual and technological work that each one develops every single day. We can find astronauts from with different fields of study and work although with similar grounds between them but meaning that besides what is knowledge of a common the team needs different fields where that are able to achieve mission goals and in critical situations they are prepared for.

Space exploration, is one of the things that bring me inspiration for many reasons that are listed above, besides the astonishing pictures that astronauts feeds us on social media channels and space agencies ones, everything else since the spaceships, suits, instruments, the famous Canadarm (Canada's Robotic Arm) and all industries that everyday work and develop knowledge and technology that can be used to step forward each day. I like to seek for this type of inspiration or whatever we can call something that brings excitement and attitudes that we can see as a reference for our personal and professional life. I found out that reading about space exploration is inspiring enough to find some parts of my self and to further my knowledge of the subject, but also by examples that are provided, not only by astronauts book but also on documentaries and space agencies content. Maybe after you try to see the Chris video or something else shared by anyone that do something related, who knows if you will be also surrendered and be also inspired on.

Among of everything I read and see regarding space exploration, there are a lot that is draw by the same common laws of discipline, development and tests because of the level that these matters stake. It's also inspiring that from many nations, from many manufactures, companies, scientists, astronauts or any other field area, the mission and the goals are well defined and the methods to achieve them are always clear for anyone on board. Maybe that are other factors, but I believe that these grounds are a recipe of inspiration and specialty paths of success and history.

Last but not least: "There is no problem so bad you can't make it worse..." yes... but we have a tendency to believe that we can make it worse... a disaster or even a catastrophe... it's the way that we prefer to look for the glass half empty instead of half full, that's a matter of attitude or by a miss leading leadershipment that is not prepared to inspire people or teams as working together to achieve a greater goal than yesterday. Whatever makes you inspire and follow into a greater level than yesterday should be a proper habit in life to be an exemplary an a bit less flawless human being.
