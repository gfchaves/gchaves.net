This week our company held a sunset style meeting to share our results, objectives but mainly to push out a new strategy for the upcoming years. Besides our work, customers relationships, what we achieved and the awards that were conquered the main focus that our CEO pointed out was a need to reborn. At the beginning, I was struggling to figure how much or why the company needs regarding the current projects beeing developed and the current country and market conditions.

With a simple, but hell sure, reflection about the company's original DNA by making small comparisons of what we were and what we've done for the last sixteen years, I realized that we came down into a constant and predictive work for our daily basis. regardless the necessity that all companies have to perform regular but lucrative work, we kindly forgot some of our strengths and he surrendered into the crisis situation that we're crossing these last years. In those sixteen years, the company always know how to keep a talent members and well-balanced teams to provide a structured and segmented work that came down into a tree vertices: creativity, technology, and strategy. And those tree vertices had given proof of how talent and awarded work the company has been developed... but that's not enough! 

Everything and everyone should realize the need to a restart, something like a computer reboot... well not because of a particular system error or hardware failure, just a quick one to incorporate that latest updates that came through our door and into our marketplace. New customer needs, new technology, new trends and new dreams are those who now are driving the steering of the companies work. That's it, we can't run away from it, but our agency always had room and engagement for creativity, to deliver advertisement campaigns with a real impact on our customers and with a first to market innovation for our competitors. Not only the real market conditions had a real impact on the spirit and openness for new and innovative solutions... I would say disruptive ones, but also the team had blurred and set back on the comfort zone.

>Let's became disruptive again, please!...

Yes please, we need to fuel again our minds and our work with those smashing and crazy ideas that kept us with fear of the market reactions and customer satisfaction, like those days ago when the Internet started booming the advertising and digital communications to became the biggest channel and the fastest way to push out products, ideas, prizes and everything else. The railway of the information for the best and for the worst, but we had the courage and the fear to believe that something never done or at least not suitable at first sight could be a tremendous success and a something worthy of a prize that can remember our pride, our capacity for teamwork, our engagement and real commitment to the mission. The fueling process isn't easy has it sounds, we should have moments and others to inspire us but we definitely need more than that. The fueling process, in my opinion, is way harder and should be done frequently, like small daily actions, samples, pictures, sentences, articles, training, one-to-one engagement and mentoring... and so on, but it also should be adjusted and fit in an individual way and on the team needs. A leadership works on a hard way to keep up the company and employees to their best of talent and mindfulness.

We review some of the company's work big stones that lead us to became one of the best marketing agency and to belong to the biggest digital group in Europe. We were remembered of our audacity and courage to build digital "weapons" and "shuttles" to drive our customer's campaigns at best they could be done. But we also saw some the actual work that was recently awarded at Cannes festival. Simple, effective and technologic trendy, a reachable work on the budget and on manpower... the creative idea and concepts were tremendous. One of those that I still keep present is the new Qantas out of office travelog (you can see more about here), a simple but effective way that represents our kind of work. Instead of that ugly and meaningless Outlook out of office automatic reply, you get a personalized message with photos that you can take on our out of office time. Many more great examples out there, that can truly inspire us for a better job, to expand and open our minds to new concepts and stages that can leverage our customers and our ideas into the market.

>Creativity, technology and strategy - Let's push the triangle!

A bit of renaissance in all of the company's vectors! Leadership is demanding and I truly believe that we need that, sometimes we need to set back, rethink, regroup, became with a new draw and perform a little renaissance into our selfs to be able the company's renaissance itself as a team.

>The world is changing, let's change with them!

It's inevitable and I believe that's is a good thing, we need change, the world needs a change in many aspects regardless the jobs, politics or beliefs, changes bring new challenges, uncomfortable zones, and fear. That fear, that challenge that can drive up each individual into a great good on his work and life. Not only for individual growth but for pure satisfaction and happiness... yes happiness on work, on each day that we set and start to perform our task, to be able to deliver an extra and do questions about it, it's enough? Is the best of we can do? Is innovative? Is a real push? Accept the answers and have the courage and pride for the modifications or even to restart all over again.

Mission has changed, we're now facing different times, different challenges, and differents audiences that have changed the market and the world itself. So we need to face those changes and be courageous and fearless on performing our work to impact has before we done it. Conditions and inspiration are the main ingredients for every single member, not only should leadership inspire but each one of us should look for everyone on the team and keep in mind that together we have the strength and the tools to rely again on our company premises and pride that kept us from these first sixteen years of work.

Each year we had the annual meet up, but this last one became special. Maybe because I'm getting older or because I saw my feelings and thoughts reflected on each leadership word and represented on each image. With a structured strategy, that will rely on creativity and technology we should have the right ingredients connected to became our fuel for inspiration, work and achievements. As a single member, inspired, as a team reborn and as a company a proud is rising for the upcoming challenges and times. Let's hope that we can keep up with the strategy, with the renaissance opportunity and work hard for open space on market and on our customers to deliver innovation, creativity and technologic solutions that can continue to fill up our name and our company pride.

Let's change, let's push for the triangle and for the strength that it represents us and on our work. We need to change, we need to comply and become better versions of ourselves. Let's do this, and next year, I hope that I can back, read, reflect and evaluate on this new better triangle. Let's take a second and thanks for the opportunity and for the trust on each of us and on our capabilities as individual and as a team.


Thank you, Filipa, Pedro and Nuno for this triangle that now has a new strategy that will lead to a new creativity fulfilled of technology. Thank you for trusting on the team and the opportunity to change. - Let's do this.
