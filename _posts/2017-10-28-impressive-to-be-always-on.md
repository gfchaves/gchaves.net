Another season, another set of races and almost on the finals decisions and after so many hours and effort we can see that it's has enough energy to continue on the threshold of what the physical laws allow what we know about the human-machine interaction.

It's a real deal when we do what fuels our hearts that so many power can drive thoughts, words and everything else that for anyone else on a first judgment would be something like: how about is this kid crazy...? Is it can be something like love? We could compare this feeling regarding, for instance, a relationship that a mother as to a son, or a father, or any other special tie that we all feel for that particular person. But we can find a real inspiration when we can see how much of that same strength and power could be used to what we do on our daily basis.

Not the first time? No, it's the second time that I saw or know about this maneuver performance, and besides we don't know what it's on his mind on that freaking fasting seconds I believe that he believes of his passion and true love that we put through each time forgetting everything else and every variable that we all know that could injure or cause a more serious damage, even a permanent one. When this energy and passion are at most higher altitude we detect miles away, a presence, a special bright on the eyes and on each gesture.

I also know that we can't live every day on this edge, although we just have to find or push for the conditions to our selfs on it. It's not about something cliche alike or some daily inspirational thought or picture, I'm talking about something deeper, raised in our bones, inflicted on our hands, burned on our skin and pushed through our words and actions, it's a passion for what we do and on how we can deliver that out as our final work for customers, friends, family and every single one that we don't know.

On every race, on every life day, we have a chance to build and fuel this passion, to thrive and prospect in ourselves and have the ability to spread and contaminate every one on our team and on our company. I find obstacles, bad tolerance, unwilling attitudes, unimpassioned co-workers, unfitted equipment, bad decisions from leadership, bad timing, miracles on time schedules ... they find, bad weather, bad tires, bad sponsors, unfitted racing rules, unsympathetic competitive environment... but we both can find and cultivate amongst us the right attitude.

>"This is Honda! I believe in Honda..."  - Marc Marquez (2015)

Two full years passed on the same principle that moves his passion, and we still see that attitude on every single lap. Until we believe we have to push up to limit! We always saw the real progression and technological evolution when people stopped to fight against and started to believe! That's it's the basic foundation for our faith that could let us find new ways, new business, progression and breakthroughs on what was previously given as known truth. Build up that passion, those basic principles that would give us the fuel to full fill our hearts on our missions.

>"the machine can't keep up on the man.."

I've heard on the past one coworker said: "dam... the machine can't keep up on the man..." and as strange as it sounds it's one of the things that hurts me the most. At this time on our "championship" we still have to fight against our competitors and at the same time against our tools... and that it's a crucial factor for great teams, for great "riders" and great "leaders" losses their faith and start breakdown. We live in the time that the last thing we should fight against is our daily tools as Marc Marquez can't spend time on fighting against his RCV. Both are the state of the art on their talent because both are the result of real hard work of their "manufactures", teams, family and especially of their passions! A team that can breed passion throughout the day can accomplish real-time and historical results, and that's something that we see on the track and on our business. Passion pushes to limits, limits push challenges, and challenges can change people.

The leadership concerns should start when those with this kind of passion, "riders" that can drop and pick up from the ground on tight corners heavy machines and at the same time challenge physics laws, are starting to slow down... that's is the real deal. A powerful engine with a printed DNA to live up at redline, should be on the redline, must have track and fuel to burn and bring results and business back home. So please, stop everything that can prevent the fuel being pumped on those members that have these "RCV" alike hearts and attitudes engines. They are the passion and the builders that can make a real difference on their work, on building up great teams and as a final result a successful business for everyone.

Thank you, Marc! It's remarkable how you keep me reminded that when the world and the law are seeing "us" already in the fall, our attitude, plus a bit of luck and with a top of courage, can dictate the opposite in a blink of an eye.
