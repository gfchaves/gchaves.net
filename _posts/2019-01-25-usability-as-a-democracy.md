Quite a strange title though... but in the ages where technology is way faster than an F-14 tomcat taking off from an aircraft carrier? (150 knots in 2 seconds :P), and applied on our own democratically government policies is a very tricky way to believe it right? Well... isn't... but how much? We all know that a lot of bureaucracy takes place when we're talking of these matters. Not only by the stick regulations and law enforced policies but also regarding some inertia law that we're all victims of... that's right! We all have some concerns when taking new risks, especially if they are connected directly into "the main combustion chamber" of the "engine of evolution. Also if we take security concerns we may put down all the "parking brakes" that are available, and it's a very good pattern to keep up with safety regulations and having a good sleep at night.

Regarding all of these matters we have a good tendency to vote for speed.. that means to have something that allows us to have that fastest "take-off" possible... and sometimes we forget about some basic issues that we might know that are very important. That being said, and personally, I sometimes forget that are some "mavericks" among us regardless of the "department" or "military status" that we could have earn. But where am I taking this idea off?

Well, think about having your own company where you could determine some strict policies and regulations when you're talking about how your developers should take best practices in concern every day of their code days... yes. Some policies and user guides that can take you in a deep dive on how you have to develop your applications by taking some of the best practices on user-experience and on data types that you have to concern, when your're designing your applications on a "brief-like" mission that you have to complete for your company or in this scenario for your own country because "his" is your client. It's like the "call for action" that you feel in your ear because you're being called to provide services and a new system for your own government. Despite my personal believes or ideals, I was called to perform "a technological mission" for my country, and they give me some "detailed mission guides" that I must have a count for. Not a singular "weapon" or special consideration, but a fully comprehensive user guide of how we should design and develop a 3.0 web application by taking the user experience and data-driven design headed for. Don't believe? yeah... I also had my doubts but check it out:

Usability [https://usabilidade.gov.pt/](https://usabilidade.gov.pt/) is a portal where we can find the policies and best practices that our own government has decided and written in clear words and examples that show us what should be the right way that we must have a count on developing public-faced content portals! That's right! Did you find at your own company such practices somewhat explained with this detail? Code, interface, and user-guide samples? Wow, I've never expected to find with so many details and guides on a public website. At least exists and should be a great start for any new project.

Also our government has published a specific set of security concerns and guidelines for mobile, applications and databases, regarding security and layers of authentication between them. You can find the document here. There's also an official guide with the formats and architectural guidelines and styles to be implemented on new applications. I didn't know that we as a country have these powerful and good documents provided by our government even if I'm not agreeing with some details on them, it's a very good start and important documents that face the concern and the evolution necessary for the upcoming applications and online public services.

I couldn't find how much these documents are updated, remember those 150 knots in 2 seconds of technology progress, but these last ones that I could read seem pretty updated withing the major and current standards by the industry. And you, at our own country there are these guide lines and regulations?
